Hello,

You can directly download the code and start using it. Repo contains all requred files with icons, images etc.

Open index.html in your browser

Do not change the location to any file, if you do then change it import path in all other files too.

I have used only HTML,CSS, JavaScript to build this project.

If no data if fetched from API and you see "too many request" error in console that means you exhauted the daily limit to fetches,
you have to wait for 24 hours to get it renewd.

Design is fully responsive and work good on all screen devices.

Thanks
